2 3 4 #powers for people in awareness level zero, one and two respectively.


0.80 #susceptibility value for people in awareness level zero
0.50 #susceptibility value for people in awareness level one
0.30 #susceptibility value for people in awareness level two


#below is a cost matrix
#for people in awareness level zero:
7.00  #cost per individual to reduce susceptibility from s to zero
6.00  #cost per individual to reduce susceptibility from s to s/3
5.00  #cost per individual to reduce susceptibility from s to 2s/3

#for people in awareness level one:
5.00  #cost per individual to reduce susceptibility from s to zero
4.00  #cost per individual to reduce susceptibility from s to s/3
3.00  #cost per individual to reduce susceptibility from s to 2s/3

#for people in awareness level two:
3.00  #cost per individual to reduce susceptibility from s to zero
2.00  #cost per individual to reduce susceptibility from s to s/3
1.00  #cost per individual to reduce susceptibility from s to 2s/3


#As can be seen below, they are the probability values
#I have described here, only for one strategy how it works.
#Rest all being the same.
#The fourth value ie the value of person remaning at susceptibility 's' is calculated directly by subtracting from 1 the sum of probabilities in one row.
#As seen in strategy S0, since all three values in a row are zero, Probability of remaining at Susceptibility 's' even after delay is 1.

Strategy S0
#For awareness Level Zero:
0.00 #probability of an individual to reduce susceptibility from 's' to zero
0.00 #probability of an individual to reduce susceptibility from 's' to s/3
0.00 #probability of an individual to reduce susceptibility from 's' to 2s/3

For awareness Level One:
0.00 #probability of an individual to reduce susceptibility from 's' to zero
0.00 #probability of an individual to reduce susceptibility from 's' to s/3
0.00 #probability of an individual to reduce susceptibility from 's' to 2s/3

For awareness Level Two:
0.00 #probability of an individual to reduce susceptibility from 's' to zero
0.00 #probability of an individual to reduce susceptibility from 's' to s/3
0.00 #probability of an individual to reduce susceptibility from 's' to 2s/3
