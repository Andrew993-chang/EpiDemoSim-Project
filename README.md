# EpiDemoSim
EpiDemoSim is a tool  designed to help control and arrive at conclusions when dealing with epidemics in Urban area. Here, Urban area refers to area wherein there live two classes of people, those who live in Slum area where facilities, even basic ones, are lacking  and Upmarket Area where most of the facilities are readily available.  There is movement of people from one Region to another, main reason of it being employment. The people living in Slum are not mostly concerned or even educated when it comes to knowing that they have an infection. So if an infection starts spreading in such Urban Scenario, how  will it  progress and how should government tackle this problem with varying strategies  is what this model depicts.
